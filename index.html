  <h2 style="color: red "><u>About HTML</h2></u>
  <div class="p">
  <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </b>is the <u>standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser</u>. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
<p> Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
<p>HTML can embed programs written in a <i>scripting language </i>such as <i>JavaScript</i>, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of <i>CSS</i> defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

<p>In 1980, physicist <strong><i>Tim Berners-Lee</i></strong>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>

<h2 style="color: brown "><u>About CSS</h2></u>
<div class="p">
<b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a style sheet language used for <u>describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML</u>.
<ul>
  <li> CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</li>
  <li> CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.</li>
  <li> This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
  The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
  In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p></div>

  <p><b> CSS</b> was first proposed by <b><i>HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</i></b> on October 10, 1994.At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.</p></div><br>
